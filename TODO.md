# TODO

### Known bugs

[ ] Clear warning "Links must not point to '#'. Use a more descriptive href or use a button instead"

[x] After alert widget is closed, it doesn't reopen until the page is refreshed


### Finishing the necessary features

[x] Way to show that a student has passed out of fundamentals - need to have a clear check box - TBH the way I did this isn't great, and I need to think more about how we will use this feature

[x] History of classes that the student has attended -- class checkins list on student info


### UI flow

#### Other

[ ] Add success/failure to admin sign in

[x] Form validation, especially for new student form— everything should check for name and email, new student form should check for waiver

[ ] Code of conduct and waiver should be in app and need to be signed — need to be included in the app - blocked waiting for wavier and Code of Conduct text

[x] Remove "additional info" where possible, or maybe move it to the admin confirm page


### Style

[ ] Logo for nav


### Data organization

[ ] Connect dance events to dance checkin events-- right now they just have the day (date), also, how do we do foreign keys?


### JS tools

[ ] What is flow typing? How does it actually work?
