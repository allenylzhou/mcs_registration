# TODO

### From 2018-06-20 Sync

[ ] "Returning students" need to say "Class checkin"

[ ] Do the waiver and CoC need to show up again if the student has already agreed to them?-- would be better if there were fewer items on the page

[ ] West coast swing needs to be on the dances list

[ ] Only people new to WCS get the discount-- need to update "New Dancer" note logic

[ ] Want to be able to pre-load guestsâ€” maybe have "guest" as a field in the student profile

[ ] Put the year with the month for the last monthly pass

[ ] Pre fill out classes if the student has a monthly pass for N classes for M months-- look up the class that they got the pass with

[ ] For a dance event, show the total number of people checked into the class and/or dance


### Known issues

[ ] If you click on the waiver and CoC checkmark, the modals don't open

[ ] Dance events are not connected to dance checkin events-- right now they just have the day (date), but maybe we should do foreign keys?



### Style

[x] Logo for nav

[x] Nice FB link (because I wanted to)


### JS tools

[ ] What is flow typing? How does it actually work?
