# TODO


[ ] Workshop or special event checkin flow

[x] Add birthday to new student form

[x] Add "member since" because it would be a shame to lose that historical info for our members

### From 2018-06-20 Sync

[x] "Returning students" need to say "Class checkin"

[x] West coast swing needs to be on the dances list

[x] Only people new to WCS get the discount-- need to update "New Dancer" note logic

[x] For a dance event, show the total number of people checked into the class and/or dance

[x] Put the year with the month for the last monthly pass

[x] Pre fill out classes if the student has a monthly pass for N classes for M months-- look up the class that they got the pass with

[x] Want to be able to pre-load guestsâ€” maybe have "guest" as a field in the student profile

[x] Do the waiver and CoC need to show up again if the student has already agreed to them?-- would be better if there were fewer items on the page


### Known issues

[x] If you click on the waiver and CoC checkmark, the modals don't open

[x] On the home page, even after you close the alert, if you refresh the page, the alert shows up again

[x] Profile updates overriding admin info and cached latest monthly pass


### Style

[x] Logo for nav

[x] Nice FB link (because I wanted to)


### JS tools

[ ] What is flow typing? How does it actually work?
