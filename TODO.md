# TODO

### Known bugs

[ ] Dance events are not connected to dance checkin events-- right now they just have the day (date), but maybe we should do foreign keys?


### UI flow

### Finishing the necessary features

[x] Need to be able to see if a student has paid for a monthly pass for that month, and have they paid for one class or two?

[x] If the student wants to get a monthly pass, need to distinguish between the beginning of the month when they need to pay and the rest of the month when they've already paid -- kind of done but maybe not clear enough for the admin

#### Other

[x] Clean up tables for class and dance checkin history-- look into https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-table ?

[ ] Add success/failure to admin sign in

[x] Form validation, especially for new student form— everything should check for name and email, new student form should check for waiver

[x] Code of conduct and waiver should be in app and need to be signed — need to be included in the app

* [x] Code of conduct

* [x] Waiver - the modal is up, but we're blocked waiting for waiver text

[x] Remove "additional info" where possible, or maybe move it to the admin confirm page


### Style

[ ] Logo for nav


### JS tools

[ ] What is flow typing? How does it actually work?
