# TODO

- Sign out button-- be careful because unless you auth, you can't write to the test DB

- Profile editing page-- need to be able to add info about the dancer

- Way to show that a student has passed out of fundamentals

- New student form also checks the student into the class for the day- or maybe add that as an option?

- Connect dance events to dance chekcin events-- right now they just have the day (date)
