# TODO

### From 2018-08-29 form filling notes

[x] When you enter the name of the referral, the box should get checked automatically

[x] Phone number validation JS lib -- really not necessary, neither is email validation beyond checking that there's a value

[x] Set default date across the app, save in a cookie that expires in 24 hours

[ ] Typeahead for checking into dance

[x] Adjust form size when on desktop

[x] Admin checkin in navbar


### Feature requests

[x] Batch/Admin form data entering mode with minimal steps-- should be very hidden from normal users, only work in desktop mode, enable minimal data entry

[ ] Workshop or special event checkin flow

[ ] Have to manually approve new admin accounts


### JS tools

[ ] What is flow typing? How does it actually work?
